      <p class="text"><i>Terrain Projects</i> re-align the human spirit with nature by curating social spaces with contemporary multimedia experiences. The worldview of human-nature separation that has saturated society is the underlying cause of Earth’s ecological crisis. This undermines the longevity of technological solutions as they exist within an unsustainable foundation of separation. <i>Terrain Projects</i> function to bridge this misalignment through incubating playful social spaces and collaborative projects with ideas across diverse disciplines and knowledge systems. Simultaneously, <i>Terrain Projects</i> reinforce the transformative reconciliatory effect interdisciplinary arts can have on human-nature relatedness in civic life.<br><br>

        The current geo-political climate continues to induce an attitude of not caring, that obstructs prioritising the environment with strong Earth jurisprudence. To fall back in love with the Earth would be to recognise what is lost when we are not in love. This same threads then directs us towards questioning what made us fall out of love with the Earth in the first place. Each <i>Terrain Project</i> explores a dimension of our ecological web, providing a space to reconcile our relationship with it, piece by piece. Decentralising our human positionality places the emerging posthuman in a context of deep time, as geological fragments apart of a larger ecosystem.<br><br>
        
        As each epoch of the Earth is immortalised in layers, <i>Terrain Projects</i> allow space for us to ask what kind of geological sedimentary imprint humans would like to leave behind. This question is raised in an effort to understand what lies within our geosocial formations so that we can contribute as sustainable co-existent posthuman-beings.<br><br>
        
        Our <i>Terrain</i> is a symbol that unites us. During social, ecological, political and economic upheaval, we must all remember the planet and all of its truly borderless terrain as one ecosystem. Our terrain will always be the fabric of our society.<br><br>
